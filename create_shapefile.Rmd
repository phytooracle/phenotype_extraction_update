### Field map identification 
# Must add rows to fieldmap If there are split rows
DataTable <- read.csv("./fieldmaps/2024_Maize_Fieldmap.csv",header = T, check.names = FALSE)
names(DataTable) <- make.names(names(DataTable))

# Select the columns you're interested in
DataTable <- DataTable[, c("Plot", "Range", "Column")]

fieldMap<-fieldMap(fieldPlot=DataTable$Plot, fieldRow=DataTable$Column, fieldColumn=DataTable$Range, decreasing=T)

# Rotate matrix about x-axis (reverse order of rows)
fieldMap <- fieldMap[nrow(fieldMap):1, ]

names(fieldMap) <- make.names(names(fieldMap))

# Create a shapefile - interactive
# It is very important to highlight that four points need to be set at the corners of the trial according to the
# following sequence (1st point) top left corner, (2nd point) top right corner, (3rd point) bottom right
# corner, and (4th point) bottom left corner.(i.e. clockwise from the top left)
### NOTE: You must change the ncols and nrows to match the fieldmap, be aware of the addtion of split rows
